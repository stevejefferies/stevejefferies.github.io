# Evolution of a tester

Whilst recently writing a presentation for this years EuroSTAR conference I started examining the role a tester and how this has evolved over the past decade. The following post summarises these thoughts, for a full version of this, check-out my presentation from EuroSTAR which will be livestreamed on 25th July at 2pm BST.

## Definition of a tester

What is the role of a tester? In overly simplistic terms, a testers role is to validate the requirements have been met. How this is achieved of course adds significant complexity to the definition of the role, but even this simplistic definition throws up questions:

1. How are we validating? A huge field in its own right, we have changed our approaches to testing remarkably over the past decade, and I fully expect this to continue to change and evolve over the next 10 years, likely even more remarkably - but this is not a forward looking post...
2. How do we get our requirements? Today Agile methodologies reign supreme over the software development world. The Agile manifesto values "working software over extensive documentation", thats not to say that requirements dont exist, just not in the comprehensive way they once did back in a traditional Waterfall project. With this change, a lot of the knowledge around what "working" means is now shifted into peoples heads. The tester role of "validating requirements" therefore requires the tester to retain large volumes of data about the software, and using that effectively can be a challenge.

So we have an evolution in how we test, and we have a shift in what we define as being tested. Lets explore both in more detail.
