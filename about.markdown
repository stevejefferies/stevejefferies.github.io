I'm an experienced automation and performance test architect, specialising in delivering transformative, efficient and scalable solutions to the technical test problems that teams encounter. I have extensive experience in supporting projects in their adoption of automation, from inception to production to deliver maximum benefit from their investment.


I have had exposure to working with teams and projects of varying sizes and test maturity. From large multinational projects with years of testing behind them through to start-ups just beginning their story. Each team has unique requirements requiring a tailored solution. I am a firm believer in the right tool for the job to achieve seamless integration, not fitting the team around the tool.


I enjoy learning and embracing the latest developments in the industry and learning from the experience of others. Reach out and say hello, I always welcome discussing innovative ideas and solutions to the latest problems teams are facing.


Life is not all about work though. Outside of the office I like to break from technology, enjoying running and mountain biking to balance out all those hours at a desk. I enjoy spending time socialising with friends as well as spending quality time with my family. Of course, being a nerd at heart, technology is never far away and I enjoy working on personal projects when time allows.
